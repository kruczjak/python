Write a function called analyze that takes a filename as a parameter and displays the three graphs produced in the previous lesson, i.e., analyze('inflammation-01.csv') should produce the graphs already shown, while analyze('inflammation-02.csv') should produce corresponding graphs for the second data set. Be sure to give your function a docstring.

```python
def analyze(filename):
	'''Analyze something'''
```
